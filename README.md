Heart Disease Prediction
Problem Statement
Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, making early detection and accurate diagnosis critical for effective treatment and prevention. This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease in patients using a multivariate dataset containing 14 key attributes related to patient health.

The dataset includes attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, oldpeak (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest), the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels, and Thalassemia. The goal is to build a machine learning model to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on these features.
